I am a master's student in Computer science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research and general interest lie in the field of theoretical machine learning. I am interested in creating new and efficient learning algorithms for large datasets. I am also interested in the probabilistic perspective of deep learning and Gaussian processes. Before coming to NYU, I was an engineer at HSBC and before that, I studied computer engineering at PICT, Pune.

My current interests in a nutshell include:
<ul>
	<li>Theory for machine learning</li>
	<li>Algorithms for big data</li>
	<li>Bayesian machine learning</li>
</ul>



Outside of work, I enjoy co-op video games and love to travel.

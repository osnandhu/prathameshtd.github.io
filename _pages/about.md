I am a master's student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research and general interest lie in the field of theoretical machine learning. I am interested in creating new and efficient learning algorithms for large datasets. I am also excited about bayesian methods in deep learning.

Before coming to NYU, I worked as a software engineer at HSBC, Pune. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from PICT, Pune.

My current interests in a nutshell include:
<ul>
	<li>Theory for machine learning</li>
	<li>Algorithms for big data</li>
</ul>
